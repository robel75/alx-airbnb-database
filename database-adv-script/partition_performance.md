# Partitioning Performance Report

## Implementation
The Booking table was partitioned by range on the start_date column with yearly partitions. Data from the original Booking table was migrated to the new partitioned table.

## Performance Testing
Queries filtering bookings by start_date range showed improved performance after partitioning. The database scanned only relevant partitions instead of the entire table, reducing query execution time significantly.

## Conclusion
Partitioning based on start_date effectively optimized query performance on the large Booking table, especially for date range filters common in booking searches.
