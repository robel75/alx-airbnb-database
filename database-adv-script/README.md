# Subqueries â€” ALX Airbnb Database

This file contains advanced SQL queries using subqueries to retrieve filtered results from the Airbnb clone database. The queries demonstrate both non-correlated and correlated subqueries, useful for data aggregation and filtering based on related tables.
## File: subqueries.sql

### 1. Non-Correlated Subquery

Query:  
Find all properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0.

sql
SELECT properties.id, properties.name, properties.location
FROM properties
WHERE (
    SELECT AVG(rating)
    FROM reviews
    WHERE reviews.property_id = properties.id
) > 4.0;
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, email
FROM users
WHERE (
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM bookings
    WHERE bookings.user_id = users.id
) > 3;
